# Customer & Sales Insights from Amazon Clothing Transactions

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset of Amazon clothing sales transactions from 2024-2025. The goal is to extract actionable business insights related to sales, returns, customer behavior, pricing, and delivery performance.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Clean and preprocess messy real-world data (handle missing values, inconsistent types, outliers).
- Formulate and test business hypotheses.
- Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate exploratory analyses.
- Derive insights on sales trends, returns, pricing, and delivery.
- Visualize data effectively with clear, insightful charts.
- Structure reproducible code and document findings for sharing.
- Communicate recommendations to product and operations teams.

## EDA Outline

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Check data types; convert dates.
- Handle missing values.
- Remove duplicates.
- Validate price and discount consistency.
- Outlier detection and treatment.
- Feature engineering (order month, weekday, discount amount, unit price, delivery speed flags).
- Aggregate customer-level metrics (total spend, order counts, return rates).

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- **Univariate:** Distribution of prices, discounts, ratings, delivery times.
- **Bivariate & Multivariate:** Revenue trends, discount vs quantity, return rates by category/brand/age/device.
- Customer segmentation (RFM and behavior).
- Delivery performance and hotspots.
- Anomaly detection for suspicious orders.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing Examples
- Higher discounts increase quantity but raise return rates.
- Longer delivery times reduce ratings and increase returns.
- Younger age groups show different buying and return behaviors.
- Mobile users have different return patterns than desktop users.
- Premium brands show different return trends.

### 4. Advanced Analytics
- Cohort analysis for customer retention.
- Price elasticity estimation.
- Return prediction modeling prototype.
- Identification of delivery delay hotspots.
