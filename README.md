# Exploratory Data Analysis Repository

This repository contains multiple exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects. Each dataset has its own folder with Jupyter notebooks, code, and outputs specific to that analysis.

## Folders / Analyses
- Amazon Clothing: Analysis of Amazon clothing sales dataset, including sales, trends, and distribution.
- Train: Analysis of train-related data such as schedules, delays, and ridership patterns.
- Textual Inconsistencies: Data quality checks focusing on string inconsistencies, duplicates, and normalization.
- Bus Fare: Analysis of bus fare data.
- Train Station: EDA on station-level attributes.

## How to Run
- Clone this repository.
- Navigate into the folder of interest
- Open the Jupyter/Python notebook
- Run the code to reproduce the analysis.

## Notes
- Each folder is independent — there’s no shared requirements file.
- To run the notebooks, you’ll typically need pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and python installed. The notebooks can be run on colabs as well.
